# tec-Plot-PCB
tec1 controlled PCB board ink plotter

a simple setup to reproduce pcbs by applying permanent marker ink to a pcb directly. let it dry then put it
thru a mix of HCL and H2O2 to etch away copper that has not been covered by the marker ink.


this video shows a perfect simple setup thay would work on the tec1.

" This is my attempt of putting some leftover hardware together 
to build a plotter to help me create PCB designs from scratch.
It plots directly onto the copper board so all I then need to do is 
etch it, and go ! My requirements are rather humble I must admit, 2.54mm raster 
is ok for me, so is simplest SMD.
I have been using this a lot lately, and I must admit it works just 
fine. For final PCBs I still use ordering services, but not as often 
as I used to ...

It seems the the link to the python g-code GUI is dead,
I moved the ardGcodeWriter.py to the github repo down below, since
I seem to be maintaining it now. It can be found in the Extras directory.

The aduino firmware used for this is available for
download via github.
